# TCGA-WGS-Manuscripts
This repository contains reproducible code, pipelines, and resources used in whole-genome sequencing (WGS)-based analyses of cancer samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). It serves as a centralized collection of manuscript-associated code for various pan-cancer and cancer-type-specific projects.

## Manuscripts
The following WGS-based analyses are included or planned for inclusion in this repository:

### Testicular Germ Cell Tumors (TGCT)
- [**A Thiopurine-like Mutagenic Process Defines TGCT Subtypes**](https://github.com/xtmgah/TCGA-WGS-Mansucripts/tree/main/TCGA-TGCT)
